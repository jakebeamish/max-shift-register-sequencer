# max-shift-register-sequencer
 A Max implementation of a shift register sequencer like the MTM Turing Machine and the Klee Sequencer

- Intuitive rhythmic input notation in binary
- Consise decimal notation for saving and exploration
- Arithmetic operations create variations
- Complementary rhythms from inverted bits
- Pattern-morphing by global or per-step inversion probability
- Forward and backward bit shifting
- Output triggers
- Scalable CV out (with quantizer?)
